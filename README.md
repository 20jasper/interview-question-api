[@AlysshaLewin](https://github.com/AlysshaLewin), [@20jasper](https://github.com/20jasper), [@Ethodeus](https://github.com/Ethodeus), [@bytesbybianca](https://github.com/bytesbybianca), [@erikateal](https://github.com/erikateal), [@brendondsouza](https://github.com/brendondsouza), [@alondramora](https://github.com/alondramora), and [@Danamitecoder](https://github.com/Danamitecoder) collaborated to build this project. We split into two groupsâ€”one group built the front end, and the other built the backend.

## Lessons Learned:

This app taught us how to bring together the front and back end. We learned how to import and export modules as well as make our own custom modules. We learned how to use environment variables to dynamically change the port. We used innerHTML so we could use &lt;code&gt; tags to style code in the questions and HTML entities to escape certain characters like '&lt;' and '&gt;' that are misinterpreted as code.
